A rainbow is an arc of colour in the sky that can
be seen when the sun shines through falling rain. 
The pattern of colours, called a spectrum, starts 
with red on the outside and changes through orange, 
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet on the inside. 
Sometimes a second, larger, dimmer rainbow is seen.

A rainbow is actually round like a circle. On the 
ground, the bottom part is hidden, but in the sky, 
like from a flying airplane, it can be seen as a 
circle around the point opposite the Sun.

Rainbows often appear after storms, and are popular
symbols for peace in many cultures.
